# Spam-Classifier

We have built a binary classification model to detect whether a text message is spam or not (aka Ham). We used Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques for the same.

## Working

* Understanding Data
* Lemmatization
* Classification using Bag of Words technique
* Classification using Bag of Words technique
* Machine Learning models using Naive Bayes, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM Classifier
* Word Clouds for Spam and Ham
* Deep Learning techniques using Dense network and LSTM
